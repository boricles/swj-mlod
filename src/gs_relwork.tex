%I'm note entirely sure of much related work, to be honest. Uhm. Yeah. Boris? Steve?

Regarding language visualisation, there has been some work on displaying language differences on a broad scale. This includes work presenting hierarchical or cross-linguistic data\cite{Rohrdantz:2012, RMB+10}, displaying related languages (gathered from WALS) by geographical proximity and relatedness \cite{LittEACL}, displaying word meaning with a world map \cite{theron}, and displaying language locations on a globe \cite{Haspelmath_etal2008}. However, the authors are not aware of any work using maps derived from data stored in RDF as here, nor of visualisations aimed at displaying language relatedness using lexical items and location together. %Right?
