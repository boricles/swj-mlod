%Richard's hackday project aimed at querying the LLOD via ISO 639-3
%code. At that time, these queries worked (see below for several of
%them). Now they don't seem to return anything (hence I haven't
%included them in the MLODE hack day results). There might be some
%fairly obvious reason for them not working, but I'm not sure what it
%is. I do remember that at one point the URL or the endpoint or
%something was changed for some reasons (hosting was with Pablo's
%group?).
%I do think though that the ability to query LLOD for resources via
%language code, etc., is a very, very strong selling point for the data
%post-proceedings and for the LLOD cloud in general. We aren't going to
%get any serious users (do we currently have any users?) beyond the
%Leipzig group (and perhaps some others), if it's not functioning (or
%if we can't explain how to use it since what was once working no
%longer works).
%
%It would be great to get such "exploratory" data queries working and I
%know Richard and a few others want to submit something to the data
%post-proceedings on exactly that.
