Our initial dataset consisted of a spreadsheet containing GPS and lexical information for .... %STEVE FILL OUT 

This spreadsheet was then converted into data in RDF. We then used the tool map4rdf\footnote{This can be accessed here: \url{http://code.google.com/p/map4rdf}} to map it upon a globe, with an online portal at: \url{http://oegdev.dia.fi.upm.es/projects/map4rdf}. At this stage, we have plotted each of the Dogon villages on the map. Each point also contains additional information about the language spoken in that village. The map is available here: \url{http://geo.linkeddata.es/map4rdf-dogon/#dashboard}


%I don't really know the details too much?
