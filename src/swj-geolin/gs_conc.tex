We have shown here the workflow necessary to upload data from a spreadsheet into an RDF database and then queried using a SPARQL endpoint, and an application on this data to show geospatial mapping. Any data uploaded using the process described up to Publishing \ref{sec:pub} can be loaded into the LLOD cloud; the exact procedure for adding databases to the LLOD according to the specifications laid out in \ref{sec:intro} can be found on the OWLG website\footnote{\url{http://linguistics.okfn.org/resources/llod/}}. The LLOD already contains dozens of individual databases which are interoperable and linked - and, as shown in \ref{sec:query}, by using a SPARQL endpoint, one can immediately gather relevant data. It is hoped that the processes described here will be useful to future researchers interested in massive ontologies and the potential of the Semantic Web.
