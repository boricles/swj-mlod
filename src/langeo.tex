%This team converted a dataset in spreadsheet format that contains lexical data and GPS coordinates from Dogon languages spoken in Mali, West Africa and converted these data into RDF. They then used the tool map4rdf
%http://code.google.com/p/map4rdf/ 
%

%
%to plot Dogon villages on the map. Each point contains additional information about the language spoken in that village. The map is available here:
